Subscribing to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) Plan
==================================================

Assignment Instruction
----------------------

This instruction shows you how to subscribe to a Virtual Private Server (VPS) service plan online (https://ionos.com in this case). With a VPS subscription, you will have access to a remote server on a virtual machine (VM) in the datacenter of the hosting company. We will choose the one-minus the current long-term support (LTS) version of the Ubuntu Linux distribution as our operating system (OS) to learn how to manage the Linux server and other services.

.. note::
   - You may need to create an account with payment information for the subscription.
   - **Requirement:** The VPS plan costs $2 per month with a monthly contract.
