<h2><span class="section-number">3.1.4. </span>Part 0. Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#part-0-introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This assignment continues with Linux and expands on what you have learned about Linux scripts. The learning objectives include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Learning how to take user input for scanning and logging files</p></li>
<li><p>Modifying your working environment using <cite>.bash_aliases</cite></p></li>
<li><p>Putting user input, file scanning/logging, and <cite>.bash_aliases</cite> into one script</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is often necessary to create a set of Linux commands as an environment (including environment variables, aliases, and functions/scripts) that provide administrative users with simple ways to complete those otherwise tedious and repetitive tasks. In this assignment, we will learn some common practices of how Linux system administrators customize their Linux environment to make their life easier. The skills and concepts you learn from this activity will help you see from the perspective of information systems administration. Such an experience is a proof that you have the foundational knowledge of Linux systems and shell scripting, which assures your prospective employers that you are comfortable with the technical aspects of the job you are seeking.</p>
<p>Your personal environment is loaded when you log into a computer (when the default configurations are read from various configuration files and executed). You have some control over what goes into your environment via modifying the configurations in the files such as <cite>/etc/environment</cite>, <cite>/etc/profile</cite>, <cite>~/.bashrc</cite>, <cite>~/.profile</cite>, and <cite>~/.bash_aliases</cite>. In this activity, we will modify that configuration by creating an additional file specifically to expand the Linux environment for this assignment. To do this we must:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Create the directories and scripts needed to implement our new tools,</p></li>
<li><p>Create a script to catch user input and perform file scanning,</p></li>
<li><p>Create a script to redirect command results into specified logs,</p></li>
<li><p>Create a file <cite>~/myenv</cite> to hold the commands that create our assignment-specific environment variables and aliases, and</p></li>
<li><p>Create the <cite>./.bash_aliases</cite> file and modify it to include the file, <cite>~/myenv</cite>; and finally, we will</p></li>
<li><p>Verify that everything works as designed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To prepare for this activity, you will need to create two directories called <cite>tmp</cite> and <cite>backup</cite> in your home directory. Also, you should have created a user <cite>bin</cite> directory as part of Lab Activity 2.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create the <cite>tmp</cite> and <cite>backup</cite> directories in your user home directory (NOT the root home, or “/home”, but your user home directory). Using the <cite>mkdir directory1 directory2 …</cite> syntax, you can create multiple directories at once.</p></li>
<li><p>If you didn’t create a <cite>bin</cite> directory as part of Activity 2, do so now.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="part-1-conditional-redirection">
<h2><span class="section-number">3.1.5. </span>Part 1. Conditional Redirection<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1-conditional-redirection" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The <cite>finder_v00.sh</cite> script:</p>
<p>There is a file called <cite>finder_v00.sh</cite> within your <cite>a03/q01</cite> directory. This script can be modified to check for a specific file or directory in every user’s home directory, which is a common administrative task to perform. For example, <cite>finder_v00.sh</cite> can be used to see if all of the users have set up a <cite>backup</cite>, <cite>class</cite>, <cite>public_html</cite>, <cite>tmp</cite>, or <cite>bin</cite> directory. Using a script like <cite>finder_v00.sh</cite>, an administrator can automatically check the status of the user accounts in batch.</p>
<p>Backup first:</p>
<p>To accomplish this, the <cite>finder_v00.sh</cite> script needs to be modified. But we don’t usually modify files directly; instead, we make sure we have two copies of the file: a backup copy and a working copy. We make modifications on the working copy only, so we always have the original file to fall back to in case the task does not go as planned. In other words, we will at least not make things worse.</p>
<p>Use the directory <cite>~/class/a03/q01</cite> to record your answers for this part of the assignment.</p>
<p>1.1 Backup Copy And Working Copy</p>
<p>We want to create a backup copy and a working copy of the file we are going to modify.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Backup copy:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let us start by <cite>cp</cite> the file <cite>finder_v00.sh</cite> into your <cite>backup</cite> directory. Also, let us double-check to make sure it’s there by issuing the <cite>ls</cite> command:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><cite>cp</cite> the file to the <cite>backup</cite> directory</p></li>
<li><p>issuing <cite>ls -l ~/backup/finder_v00.sh</cite> to make sure the backup file is present in the intended directory.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>Working copy:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We are going to rename the script to a working copy because we want to be clear we are working on the right file. This may seem trivial, but it could save a day when things get hectic and you don’t even know if you could rely on the timestamps (use <cite>ls -l</cite> to see) to tell which file(s) are the working files. So, let us <cite>cp</cite> (or <cite>mv</cite>) <cite>finder_v00.sh</cite> to <cite>q01.sh</cite> as your working copy for accomplishing the required modifications.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><cite>cp</cite> or <cite>mv</cite> <cite>finder_v00.sh</cite> to <cite>q01.sh</cite>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1.2 Conditional Redirection</p>
<p>We want to run and read the scripts to learn about catching user input and redirection. Here we will first run and then read script <cite>user_input.sh</cite> to learn how to use the <cite>read</cite> command to take user input; and then run and read <cite>redirect.sh</cite> carefully to learn how to perform conditional redirection:</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Run sample script <cite>user_input.sh</cite>:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Stand on the shoulders of your predecessors! In general, programmers spend more time in reading/reusing/fixing/enhancing the code written by their colleagues. In our case, we have two short scripts (<cite>user_input.sh</cite> and <cite>redirect.sh</cite>) in the <cite>q01</cite> directory, they provide examples of how to implement the changes you need. Let’s run <cite>user_input.sh</cite> first:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>chen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$<span class="w"> </span>./user_input.sh
Please<span class="w"> </span>enter<span class="w"> </span>your<span class="w"> </span>last<span class="w"> </span>name:<span class="w"> </span>Chen
Hello.<span class="w"> </span>Is<span class="w"> </span>this<span class="w"> </span>your<span class="w"> </span>last<span class="w"> </span>name:<span class="w"> </span>Chen?
chen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We see that this script was written to interact with the user by prompting the user for their last name and will respond to user input by greeting the user and ask a question.</p>
<p>Run <cite>./user_input.sh</cite> to observe the behavior.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>Observe sample script <cite>user_input.sh</cite>:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s observe the file by <cite>nano user_input.sh</cite>. You will see:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="m">01</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">#!/bin/bash</span>

<span class="m">04</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="m">05</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">#       Sample script with no editing of the input and no default</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We see that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>The script starts with a shebang line at line #1, and followed by bunch of comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Line #7 is an echo line, which will print the prompt message to the terminal. The <cite>-n</cite> option instructs the shell not to output the trailing newline.</p></li>
<li><p>Line #8 is an input (<cite>read</cite>) line that takes “name” as variable to point to the value from user input.</p></li>
<li><p>Line #9 is another echo line that prints out the message we want. Note that, Inside the message, variable <cite>name</cite> is referenced as <cite>$name</cite>, not <cite>name</cite>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><cite>nano user_input.sh</cite> to read the code line by line to understand what it’s doing.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="3">
<li><p>Run and observe <cite>redirect.sh</cite></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s run and observe <cite>redirect.sh</cite>. When we do <cite>./redirect.sh</cite> and follow the prompt to enter <cite>a01.txt</cite>, which is a file we know exists in the directory, we see:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>chen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$<span class="w"> </span>./redirect.sh
Please<span class="w"> </span>enter<span class="w"> </span>a<span class="w"> </span>filename:<span class="w"> </span>a01.txt
chen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The file did not give us any further feedback. However, if we <cite>ls</cite> the directory, we see an additional file, <cite>success.log</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>a01.bak<span class="w">  </span>check01.sh<span class="w">   </span>redirect.sh<span class="w">  </span>user_input.sh
a01.txt<span class="w">  </span>error.log<span class="w">   </span>finder_v00.sh<span class="w">  </span>success.log
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the content of <cite>success.log</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>chen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$<span class="w"> </span>cat<span class="w"> </span>success.log

chen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously, script <cite>redirect.sh</cite> redirected some text into the file <cite>success.log</cite>. Now let us take a look at the content of the script:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="m">01</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">#!/bin/bash</span>

<p>From the <cite>redirection.sh</cite> code above, we see that:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Line #7 is an echo line that prompts user for input.</p></li>
<li><p>Line #8 takes the user input from standard input (the <cite>stdin</cite> stream, the keyboard) and save it to a variable called <cite>name</cite>.</p></li>
<li><p>Line #11 and 12, we see that this script actually produced two files: <cite>success.log</cite> and <cite>error.log</cite>. These two lines are comment messages into each of the two log files and they are overwrite redirection. So, each time when we run the script, they will create the two new files of <cite>success.log</cite> and <cite>error.log</cite>.</p></li>
<li><p>Line #18 and line #24 perform conditional redirection. When the command succeeds, <cite>1&gt;&gt;</cite> takes effect. When the command fails, <cite>2&gt;&gt;</cite> takes effect. This “conditional” action is achieved in line #18 and 24 by using file descriptors (<cite>1</cite> and <cite>2</cite>) along with redirection (append) operator <cite>&gt;&gt;</cite>.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="4">
<li><p>File descriptor</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A file descriptor (or, file handle) is a unique number that points to a data stream. The three file descriptors of most interest to us are:</p>
<table class="docutils align-default">
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>File Descriptor</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Name</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Abbreviation</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>0</p></td>
<td><p>Standard Input</p></td>
<td><p>STDIN</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>1</p></td>
<td><p>Standard Output</p></td>
<td><p>STDOUT</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>2</p></td>
<td><p>Standard Error</p></td>
<td><p>STDERR</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Graphically, these three standard data streams work like this:</p>
<img alt="Data streams" src="images/your_image.png" />
<p>For example, at line #18, <cite>ls $name 1&gt;&gt; success.log 2&gt;&gt; error.log;</cite>, we see that the command is <cite>ls $name</cite>. <cite>$name</cite> performs variable substitution to reference to the content of variable <cite>name</cite>. In our case above, we enter “a01.txt” at the read prompt, so the value of <cite>$name</cite> is “a01.txt”, which is a file that exists. Therefore, the shell will output the successful listing (<cite>ls</cite>) result to the <cite>stdout</cite> data stream (file descriptor 1), which we redirect to <cite>success.log</cite> by using <cite>1&gt;&gt;</cite>, and the <cite>2&gt;&gt; error.log</cite> part is ignored. In the case that the file does not exist, <cite>ls $name</cite> will result in an error (<cite>stderr</cite>), which data stream has file descriptor number 2. We then redirect it to <cite>error.log</cite> by using <cite>2&gt;&gt; error.log</cite>, and the <cite>1&gt;&gt;</cite> part is ignored.</p>
<p>In line#18 of <cite>redirect.sh</cite>, we use file descriptors (fd) number 1 (<cite>stdout</cite>) and 2 (<cite>stderr</cite>) to point to the data source and then use the redirection operator <cite>&gt;&gt;</cite> to direct the text stream to files. This creates a conditional redirection much like a shorthand for <cite>if</cite> statement.</p>
<p>Use <cite>nano</cite> to open <cite>redirect.sh</cite> and examine the code closely. Make sure you understand how conditional redirection works using file descriptor 1 and 2.</p>
<p>1.3 Create Conditional Redirection</p>
<p>With our understanding in user input and conditional redirection, we are ready to modify the script file <cite>q01.sh</cite>. Let us run the code, read the code, and finally modify the code.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple">
<li><p>Run <cite>q01.sh</cite>:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before we modify it, let us run <cite>./q01.sh</cite> to take a look at the results. We should get something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>OK,<span class="w"> </span>This<span class="w"> </span>is<span class="w"> </span>a<span class="w"> </span>list<span class="w"> </span>of<span class="w"> </span>where<span class="w"> </span>bin<span class="w"> </span>was<span class="w"> </span>found
Oh<span class="w"> </span>no!<span class="w">  </span>bin<span class="w"> </span>wasn<span class="s1">&#39;t found here.</span>
<span class="s1">Found bin</span>
<span class="s1">Did NOT find bin</span>
<span class="s1">ls: cannot access &#39;</span>/home/chen_admin/bin<span class="err">&#39;</span>:<span class="w"> </span>No<span class="w"> </span>such<span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span>or<span class="w"> </span>directory
<span class="m">4</span><span class="w"> </span>/home/chen_user/bin
chen_user@localhost:~/class/a03/q01$
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We don’t always want the output to be displayed on the screen like this. Log files are preferred in most cases because they are easier to read, process, and retrieve.</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="2">
<li><p>Check out the code</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now we <cite>nano q01.sh</cite> and see the script looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="m">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">#!/bin/bash</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We see that line #1 is a shebang line, line #2 is commented out but it has a command <cite>echo</cite> in there. It would be interesting to see what will happen if we uncomment it. We would want line #5, 6, 8, and 9 to be redirect to the log files. Line #11 to 13 is a <cite>for</cite> loop, which will go through the files in <cite>/home</cite> directory. We can move on to modify this piece of code by performing the following tasks:</p>
<ol class="upperalpha simple" start="3">
<li><p>Enable user input:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Modify <cite>q01.sh</cite> so that it will:</p>
<p>Enable user prompt:</p>
<p>Modify the code (#2) so that it will prompt for the user to input a filename. In this script, we are suggested to monitor the user directories that we have created, which is a good idea since we know for sure if they exist or not.</p>
<p>Enable user input:</p>
<p>To take user input, we use the <cite>read</cite> command, which will scan <cite>STDIN</cite> for user input from keyboard. Right now, the input is hardcoded to default to the <cite>bin</cite> directory, which is not what we want. We want the script to take user input. Modify line #6 can help us achieve this purpose.</p>
<p>Set up redirection:</p>
<p>Simple redirection:</p>
<p>Modify line #5, 6, 8, and 9 to properly redirect text streams to the log files. The messages would go into the right logs as specified in the comments after the commands.</p>
<p>Conditional redirection:</p>
<p>The <cite>for</cite>-loop <cite>for homedir in /home/*</cite> will parse through directory <cite>/home</cite> and assign each of the filenames (user home directories in this case) to the loop variable <cite>homedir</cite> (home directory). Each of the user home directories will then be listed for the <cite>$file</cite> user input (<cite>ls $homedir/$file</cite>). After all user home directories are iterated, the loop is “done.”</p>
<p>If the user of this script input “bin” for search, then since only some of the user accounts have the <cite>bin</cite> directory created in user home, some <cite>ls $homedir/bin/</cite> will be successful and some will say “No such file or directory”. Here our job is to modify the line of command (line #24) inside the loop so that the <cite>ls</cite> results will be conditionally sent to either <cite>error.log</cite> or <cite>success.log</cite>. The rules of the conditional redirection are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Any standard (successful) output (<cite>STDOUT</cite>) messages are redirected to the file <cite>success.log</cite></p></li>
<li><p>Any error output (<cite>STDERR</cite>) messages are redirected to the file <cite>error.log</cite></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Check Your Work</p>
<p>Make a copy of the working script <cite>q01.sh</cite> as <cite>finder_v01.sh</cite> to the <cite>backup</cite> directory.</p>
<p>Once this script is working as you check the logs are correctly created, save a copy of <cite>q01.sh</cite> in your <cite>~/backup</cite> directory as <cite>finder_v01.sh</cite>.</p>
<p>Modify <cite>a01.txt</cite>: You know what to do.
Run the check script to see how you have done in this Part.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>“In UNIX (and therefore Linux), everything is a file.” So regular text files, directories, text/data streams, or even peripherals (device files), are treated as files by the operating system. In this regard, <cite>STDIN</cite>, <cite>STDOUT</cite>, and <cite>STDERR</cite> are treated as files and each given a file descriptor (fd). If you are intrigued by this statement, check out Wikipedia and other sources to dig deeper. For example, what does this statement mean in the file system? And what does it mean from the perspective of data stream and name space? As you may find out, technology can be philosophically amazing. ^^
When the operating system opens a “file”, a file descriptor is assigned to it so that the open file is kept in track. In C language, it is called a file handle.</p>
</div>
<p>Tile two terminals:</p>
<p>It is often useful to open two terminal windows, one for editing and one for testing your code. Tile the terminal windows in large enough size so you can see the chunks and structure of the scripts, which gives you a better idea about the logic of your code blocks (paragraphs). After all, programming languages are languages, and we will learn better by seeing they have pages, paragraphs, sentences, and vocabulary just like natural languages.</p>
<p>^-O:</p>
<p>You can use ^-O to save your modifications in the editing terminal without exiting <cite>nano</cite>. ^-O will save the file and you still remain in editing mode to continue with testing in the other terminal.</p>
<p>It is always a good idea to backup your work. By default, Microsoft Word automatically keeps a copy of your file every 10 minutes, which is probably a good indicator of how much time your clients and you can tolerate a loss of work in case of a technical issue.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">3.1.6. </span>Part 2. Environment: ENVs And Aliases At User Level<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2-environment-envs-and-aliases-at-user-level" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The idea here is that you are creating your own working environment. The aliases and environment variables you are creating here are administrative tools widely used in IT workplaces. The common locations for configuring Linux environment include the <cite>.bashrc</cite> and <cite>.profile</cite> files under the user home directory. In Ubuntu, it is suggested to use <cite>~/.bash_aliases</cite> to include additional aliases. if you define the hidden file <cite>~/.bash_aliases</cite> and source it from <cite>.bashrc</cite>, it will be executed every time your log in.</p>
<p>Our goal in this next set of steps is to personalize your Linux environment by loading certain functionalities you choose every time you log in.</p>
<p>Use the directory <cite>~/class/a03/q02</cite> to record your answers for this part of the assignment.</p>
<p>2.1 Create Environment Variables And Aliases</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Create the environment definition file:
To help us do this with less typing, change to your home directory and use <cite>nano</cite> to create a file called <cite>myenv</cite>.</p></li>
<li><p>Within <cite>myenv</cite>, create two environment variables:
- defines an environment variable called <cite>MYTMP</cite> that represents your <cite>~/tmp</cite> directory
- defines a second environment variable <cite>A3</cite> that represents your <cite>~/class/a03</cite> directory. You can use the <cite>export</cite> command to perform the definitions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">MY_VAR</span><span class="o">=</span>VALUE
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>check your environment variable using the <cite>printenv</cite> command (you need to <cite>source</cite> the definition file first):</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>chen_user@vma50:~/class/a03/q02$<span class="w"> </span>printenv<span class="w"> </span>A3
/home/chen_user/class/a03
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Defines three aliases to do the following:
- <cite>vs</cite> – views the contents of <cite>success.log</cite> using <cite>cat $MYTMP/success.log</cite>
- <cite>ve</cite> – views the contents of <cite>error.log</cite> using <cite>cat $MYTMP/error.log</cite>
- <cite>rl</cite> – removes the <cite>$MYTMP/error.log</cite> and <cite>$MYTMP/success.log</cite> files.</p>
<p>The syntax for defining aliases is:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">alias</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">alias_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;command_to_run&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>To execute the <cite>myenv</cite> file and make your environment variable and alias definitions available while you are in the CLI (terminal), use the <cite>source</cite> command:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">source</span><span class="w"> </span>myenv
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Now you can try the five variables in your CLI to make sure they work.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$A3</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># will take you to the directory as defined by A3</span>
<span class="nb">cd</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">$MYTMP</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># will take you to the directory as defined by MYTMP</span>
vs<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># should show you the content of success.log in $MYTMP or give you an error if the directory or file is not available.</span>
chen_user@vma50:~/class/a03/q02$<span class="w"> </span>vs
cat:<span class="w"> </span>/home/chen_user/tmp/success.log:<span class="w"> </span>No<span class="w"> </span>such<span class="w"> </span>file<span class="w"> </span>or<span class="w"> </span>directory

ve
rl
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2.2 Create .Bash_aliases</p>
<p>Here we want to create a <cite>.bash_aliases</cite> file in your home directory that “source” the <cite>myenv</cite> file every time you log in. This can be done using <cite>nano</cite> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Change to your home directory</p></li>
<li><p>Use <cite>nano .bash_aliases</cite> to enter the following bash statements into a <cite>.bash_aliases</cite> file and then save the file.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#       Add my environment variables if the file exists.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">[</span><span class="w"> </span>-f<span class="w"> </span>~/myenv<span class="w"> </span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">then</span>
<span class="w">   </span><span class="nb">source</span><span class="w"> </span>~/myenv
<span class="k">fi</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check Your Work</p>
<p>Test the work above by opening another terminal window and then run <cite>printenv</cite> and <cite>alias</cite>. These commands should show you the environment variables and aliases you created. Changing to your <cite>~/class/a03/q02</cite> directory and running <cite>check02.sh</cite> will help you figure out what is wrong if the above doesn’t work as expected. Note that if you find any error with the check script and go back to modify your <cite>myenv</cite> file, you need to <cite>source</cite> it to populate the variables in your personal environment before checking again. When you are confident you have it working, enter DONE in the <cite>~/class/a03/q02/a02.txt</cite> file.</p>
